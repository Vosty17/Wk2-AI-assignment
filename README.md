## Project Overview
The project aims to:
- Clean and preprocess multidimensional poverty data
- Explore relationships between different poverty indicators
- Predict poverty levels using a Random Forest regressor
- Cluster countries based on deprivation patterns
- Visualize key findings through various plots

## Dataset
The dataset (`multidimensional_poverty.csv`) contains information about poverty indicators across multiple countries, including:
- Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) scores
- Education, health, and living standards deprivation percentages.
- Population in poverty
- Intensity of deprivation
- National poverty line statistics

## Requirements
