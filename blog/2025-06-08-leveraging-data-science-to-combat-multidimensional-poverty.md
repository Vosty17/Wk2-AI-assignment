Poverty isn't just about income—it’s about opportunity, dignity, and access to essential human needs. While traditional measurements focus on monetary thresholds, millions of people worldwide suffer from **multidimensional poverty**: a web of deprivations in **health, education**, and **living standards**.

To truly *end poverty in all its forms everywhere* (SDG 1), we must go beyond counting dollars and start analyzing **data**.

## A Machine Learning Approach to Poverty

This project uses data science to transform how we define, detect, and fight poverty using the **Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)**. Key indicators include:

- **Education**: years of schooling, school attendance  
- **Health**: child mortality, nutrition  
- **Living Standards**: clean water, electricity, sanitation, housing, assets

**Machine Learning Techniques:**

- **Random Forest Regression** – Predicts MPI score with an R² of 0.57  
- **K-Means Clustering** – Groups countries with similar deprivation patterns  
- **Feature Importance** – Reveals strongest predictors of poverty

## Key Insights

- **Poverty is Interconnected**: Solving sanitation can improve health and education outcomes.
- **Clusters**: Some countries face poor infrastructure, others lack education—custom strategies work best.
- **Regional Profiles**: Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Latin America each show unique MPI trends.

## From Analysis to Action

**Predictive Models** help allocate resources in advance.  
**Cluster Profiles** enable targeted interventions.  
**Feature Ranking** shows where to invest first (e.g., electricity, healthcare access).

This supports not just SDG 1, but SDGs 3, 4, 6, 7, and 10.

## Technical Stack

- **Python + Pandas**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib**

This open-source approach enables transparency and collaboration.

## Future Directions

- Add **temporal tracking** over years  
- Develop **interactive dashboards**  
- Expand into **climate resilience, gender equality**  
- Foster **global partnerships** for real-time data sharing

By illuminating the many faces of poverty through data, we can equip the world with tools to fight it more effectively. Let’s build a future where **no one is left behind**—data point by data point.
